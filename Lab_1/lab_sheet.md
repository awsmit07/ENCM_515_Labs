# ENCM 515 Lab 1

## Part 1
### Q1
**Screenshot of the console output (name, date, joke)**

### Q2
**Time stamps and cycles for the two ITM Port 31 entries (screenshot should suffice).**
*How many clock cycles are there between the two writes to the ITM Port 31?*

*How much time has elapsed?*

*What is the average amount of time taken for each loop iteration?*

### Q3
**How many clock cycles are taken to perform the floating point function?**
| Test | Value of A | Value of B | Clock Cycles Needed |
|------|------------|------------|---------------------|
|   1  |
|   2  |
|   3  |
|   4  |
|   5  |

### Q4
**How many clock cycles are taken to perform the floating point function now? Include a screenshot of the SWV Trace Log.**

### Q5
**Fix the code snippet so that the correct values are loaded in a and b. Paste your completed function here.**
```c

```

### Q6
**Take a screenshot of the Variables window after calling these functions. What do you observe?**

## Part 2
### Q7
**Screenshots of the first 250 filtered samples and the spectrum (from floating point FIR)**
*How much time is taken to filter the signal? Is this filtering going to be “good enough” for our sample rate?*

### Q8
**Screenshots of the first 250 filtered samples and the spectrum (from fixed point FIR)**

*How much time is taken to filter the signal? Is this filtering going to be “good enough” for our sample rate?*

### Q9
**Write a reflection of what you have observed and learned in this lab [approx.. 200 words max.]. Which lecture
concepts did you encounter here?**
